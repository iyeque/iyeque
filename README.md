🌟 About Me
I’m @iyeque, a passionate advocate for the power of technology to improve lives and empower communities. My philosophy is simple: the best things in life are free, and I strive to use tech to make valuable resources accessible to all. Whether it’s building open-source tools, automating processes, or sharing knowledge, I believe in creating solutions that benefit the greater good.

🔥 What Drives Me?
1. Open Source & Free Resources
I’m deeply inspired by the open-source movement and its potential to level the playing field. By making software, tools, and knowledge freely available, we can break down barriers and empower individuals worldwide.

2. Democratizing Technology
Technology should be inclusive, not exclusive. I’m committed to creating solutions that are easy to use, widely accessible, and designed to help people solve real-world problems without financial or technical barriers.

3. Learning & Sharing
I’m always eager to learn new skills and share what I’ve learned with others. Whether it’s coding, automation, or problem-solving, I believe collaboration and mentorship are key to driving progress.

🛠️ Current Projects
One for All: A comprehensive ad-blocking solution combining network-wide protection, system-level blocking, and browser extensions. Check it out here https://github.com/iyeque/one-for-all.git.
Why? Because ads are intrusive, privacy-invading, and often unnecessary. This project ensures everyone can enjoy a cleaner, faster, and safer browsing experience—for free!
Exploring Automation: I’m working on automating repetitive tasks to save time and energy for myself and others. Stay tuned for updates!
